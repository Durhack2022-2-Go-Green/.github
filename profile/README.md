# Go Green

## What is this?

GoGreen is concerned with building a social media web application aimed at helping communities to collaborate in fighting climate change and rising levels of pollution. The problem will be approached by providing a mean of peer accountability, sharing of ideas and the creation of a community of like-minded individuals.

## Tech Stack
A project will be built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, NodeJS and React). We will use RabbitMQ for message broking, Redis for in memory-caching and SocketIO to establish TCP connected chatrooms between users.
